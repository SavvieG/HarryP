      <p>If you know nothing about Harry Potter, this is what it's basically about: When Harry Potter was 1 year old there was a prophecy that was made about Voldemort (a murderer) and a baby boy born at the end of July. The boy's parents escaped Voldemort three times. There were two boys that were born at the end of July, and both their parents had escaped Voldemort three times. Those boys' names were Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. So Voldemort went looking for all the boys born at the end of July and chose the one who he thought would be the most dangerous to him. But he did not know that by trying to kill Harry he would mark him as his equal and he will have powers that the Dark Lord (BTW the Dark Lord is Lord Voldemort) knows not, and that is because Harry's mother died to save him. That was why Voldemort could not kill Harry Potter. Harry became famous because no one has ever survived one of Voldemort's attacks. Because if he wants to kill you, he will kill you. There is nothing you can do!!</p>
